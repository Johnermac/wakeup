Its a simple "grep -rn" that searchs potentially dangerous strings in a language and sends to fzf. 
You can analyze the code there or press enter and it will open vscode directly on the line grep'd.

```
sudo apt install bat
sudo apt install fzf
sudo apt install code
```

```
usage: ./wakeup.sh <folder_path> <option>
```

options:
  py
  rb
  js
  php
  go
  docker
  k8s

> add to check's folder if u wanna check something else

        ZZZ
